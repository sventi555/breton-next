  Excerpt from my play, LAST SHOW ON EARTH TRADEMARK SYMBOL!, which recently had
  a reading at Nightwood's Groundswell 2021 Festival:



  AYO: What’s one thing you always wanted?


  What, you don't have an answer ready? Thought you’d have more time to decide?


  Well that’s part of the secret of no bad timing: there’s also no more time.


  Hear me out. What if every time you had to make a choice, you made it like it was the end of the world?


  AWFUL things would happen.


  Wouldn’t they?


  AWFUL, BEAUTIFUL, CHAOTIC things would happen.


  But wait.


  All that time leading up to now you were making choices like you did have more time- infinite time- and did that stop the bad things from happening?


  Did that keep Chaos tethered to the cage just beneath the surface?


  No.


  Oooooops.


  For all your trying, you couldn’t keep things tidy. You couldn’t keep them safe.


  So, what’s one thing you always wanted?


  ──────────────────────────────────────────────── end



  After the show I sneak onto the stage - it is no longer mine - it is never mine - the ghost light stands guard[ian].


  I can’t believe the beauty of the shadows. [The beauty of the empty is the only thing I truly worship.]


  The absence - it is so full. There is so much alive in this death of performance. I watch. I listen. I let the shadows take centre stage - I dont let them; they let me, sometimes, for a moment. I watch Nothing move. It makes those sounds.


  I feel them best when we’re like this. Then [now] [like this] I can say [proper] thank you. Thank you for holding me. Thank you for letting me. I can feel them hearing me.


  I don’t care if you believe it [that I can feel them, that they can hear me]. This is biggest gift, the only thing that little kid always wanted, and I am not sure why I get it so I can’t think of that, instead feel of them.


  I stand alone - not alone - and know that. I stand with them - with no one - and feel that. 26 years of OOF a ticking time bomb inside my trachea. I catch my shadow as they falter, swaying slightly. I watch his shape falling against their presence. Trembling. I didn’t know he was trembling. I thank. I thank. I thank. I kiss the lip of the stage and feel the heat of Ghost[light] run its fingers over my brow. You can touch me always. I dance for Spotlight, but you are the one I’m really working for.


  I see so many moments as I walk through the dark aisles. So many of us. I have to stop hand on the door and


  “Goodnight.


  Thank you.


  We’ll do it again tomorrow.”


  [An impossible gift, the thing you never dared dream of, to have those words saddling your breath, landing on them, all pooled in ghostlight.]


  Every time I leave them I am shocked at the normalcy of the world. Its brightness, its loudness, its consistency - the way it simply carries on. I have to readjust to its pace, its weight, its wanting. I cannot quite ever leave the empty, the gift of being alone - not alone - with the ghost [light], the fullness of being alone - not a lone - with the empty - the way the stories show themselves to you when you’re the only one there with a heart beat - the way stillness becomes electric - solitude in shadows, the most populous story of existence.


  Are those footfalls in the flys, or just the echoes from last century?


  I clear my throat when the lobby lights hit me, to remember that in Existence, I still have a speaking part.

  I woke up pregnant with a dangerous story.


  the baby was wet and shivering, too alive to be swallowed back down into the esophagus of dream


  and I know it was wet and shivering

  and I know it was too alive to kill 

  because i woke up with it in my mouth


  it choked me awake

  have you ever felt hands around the inside of your neck? the place the breath calls halfway to home?


  it rode my tongue bareback 

  a steer wrestler wrestling my psyche 

  desperate to steer pen to page before

  the egg yolk of dawn cracked silence 

  (“Nooo it’s safety”) across my lips


  hey

  i woke up gagging on a dangerous story

  pink puffy beds dancing like sugarplums on their hind legs before my eyes and i said this, this cotton candy nightmare is the play, so reach for the pen 

  that’s how i woke up this morning


  how about you?

  did you wake up?

  will we ever fall asleep again?

  Playing with gender roles; getting to be the one who pulls the chair out, or puts your hand on the small of their back, even though they’re the one who was born with a penis, because they’re the one who was born with a penis. Elbows on the table with just enough space between your palms to have it read as an offer, nothing urgent, just comfortable and patient in its waiting there (waiting that is also not waiting, unless (1) they read it as such and (2) they welcome it as such and only with (1) and (2) both explicitly communicated and never in any other case) leaning forward in just that way, letting them walk in front of you so you can make sure everyone gets out or in or to, and safely, and also so you can check that no one has forgotten anything as they talk and laugh and move to go out or in or to (and safely, you’re looking all ways at once.). Leading the way when they fall back in fear or uncertainty or falling back when their breath falls heavy warning against your neck (“this isn’t fear this is feeling and if you go forward guns blazing reading me as fear well then that’s just plain old egotistic phallic fallacy”). And knowing all this, without having to say a thing, falling comfortably into the performance of heteronormativity because who doesn’t want to call a cab sometimes, who doesn’t want to take a night off from being DD, who doesn’t want to try the sample platter of moving through the world As The World Expects You, of selling the world What They Think They’re Seeing and yes, they will be having dessert, and yes, you can put it on my card (and then, beneath the clink of cuff links, “you’re e-transferring me, right?”).


  Butch is balancing, wrapping stone up in tissue paper and calling it their bed, wrapping tissue paper around stone and calling it all better now, a knife in one pocket and a starfish you rescued for her in the other, clenching hard the fist of iron and then letting it melt against her fire, bleeding them out and stopping her bleeding, your knuckles wrapped in the same handkerchief.

  Cowboy had a face that looked like the sea had smoothed it over. He came into the cafe and waited while I ordered.


  “I’m a kung fu master,” he told me in a voice that sounded like gravel and cigarettes, “but these days I just teach the little ones, the women, the kids.”


  I nodded, glancing at the window. Beads of rain curled down the glass, making a fun house of the world outside.


  “I walked 500 miles, from the West Coast to Halifax,” he told me, or I think he told me. Sandpaper tongues make rough shapes out of vocal cords. “Where you from?”


  “Toronto,” I said, working a lid onto the coffee cup. ‘I need to buy a Keep Cup.’


  “Toronto!” he spat back. “I hate it there.”


  “Yeah,” I started, “it’s not actually where I’m fr-“


  “Tell ya what, time I went to Toronto, I got off the plane, got out at the station, went to my room at the Royal York. I tried to talk to the folks outside, couldn’t get a word from anyone. So I took my suitcase, walked down to the front desk and said to the guy, ‘Ok, I wanna check out. How much do I owe ya?’ He said, ‘You didn’t even use the room.’ I said, ‘Okay.’ And I got in a cab and I said, ‘Driver, how much to Montreal?’ and I paid him the cash and we went.”


  “Montreal,” I said, tasting the cobblestones in my mouth as I looked into Cowboy’s eyes. Green and glassy, East Coast water pooling in the concrete pits of the dock. “Montreal is good.”


  “Yeah, but not Toronto. I hate that place.” He looked down as if shaking his head clean of the memory. When he lifted his eyes back up to me, they were warm again, shiny. “What you doing here, darlin?”


  “I’m acting,” I said.


  “Acting- oh!” Something leapt behind those polished eyes and Cowboy pulled a bag from the air, dropped a hand inside. “Acting … then I got something to show ya.” His fingers shivered the spines of papers as he spoke. “You ever feel lonely in this life, like nothing and nobody loves ya?”


  “Yes,” I said. I thought of the year that lay curled like parchment behind me. A single laugh fell through a crack I hadn’t noticed carved into the back of my throat. “Oh yeah.”


  The old man handed me a piece of crinkled paper.


  “I wrote this,” he said.


  I opened it up and poetry dripped across my palms. Had to cup my hands to keep the honesty from escaping in rivulets down my wrists. Typewritten stanzas, photo copied to near invisibility, leapt from a page whose dog ears stood alert to their contents.


  “It’s beautiful,” I said. I didn’t want to give it back. “How do I get a copy?”


  “You put it in your bag,” Cowboy said.


  “Oh- oh!” I folded the paper. “Thank you. It’s- thank you.” I fumbled. This stranger had taken morning and moulded it into magic.


  “Here,” Cowboy said. He dipped his fingers back into the belly of the bag and fished out a pile of neatly folded pages. He slid the top page off the stack and offered it to me.


  “It’s your resume,” I observed. His face wrinkled conspiratorially and he pressed a weathered thumbnail beneath a line of text.


  “Body guard,” I read.


  “Details: safety duties,” he read on, his fingers scratching quotations into the air. He winked and I laughed out loud. He had, at least in part, or in some realm of perception, been telling me the truth.


  “One night,” he said, as I slipped the resume into my bag, “I was walking down Gottingen. You know  that 24 hour karaoke bar they got all days of the week?”


  “Sure,” I said. I didn’t.


  “Every day of the week, the karaoke bar,” Cowboy cried, “even Monday and Tuesdays! I’m going down there,” and I imagined the old man crooning into a smoke filled room. I felt sure that when he held a microphone, dusty honey crawled out his lips. “I’m going down there, and three men come to me. They say, ‘Hey old man, you got any money?’ I say, ‘Sure I do. Why do you wanna know?’ ‘We’re gonna take it from you,’ they say.” Cowboy slung his hands onto his hips as that light jumped back into his marble eyes. “I say, ‘Ok. And how do you figure you’re gonna do that?’ And they say, ‘We’re gonna beat the shit outta you.’ So I do this-” Cowboy pulled an arm back and sunk into a lunge and suddenly his wrinkled body looked impossibly strong; for a heartbeat of the clock hands I could see the silhouette of a whole life behind the weathered skin- “and I break the one guy’s nose and the other guy, I snap his arm and I break it in three places.”


  “You’re- yea!” I said. I’m grinning like the shine of the espresso machine.


  “And these guys, they’re going, ‘Hey, hey, we were just joking!’ And I say, ‘No. No you weren’t.’”


  Cowboy didn’t try to keep me when I said I had to go. He just grabbed me in his arms and hugged me.


  “Will I see you around?” I asked him.


  “Oh sure,” he said. “I told ya. Halifax is my home.”


  “You’re really cool,” I told him.


  “You are too.” The words rolling off his tongue like tobacco through a frog’s croak.


  As the bus pulled up outside I touched his shoulder.


  “I wish I could talk to you all day,” I told him. I meant it.


  The bus rolled to a stop beside us and the old man fixed his rain coat. I climbed on board, dropped the two coins into the box as Cowboy saluted me. The doors closed and when I looked out again, he’d somehow disappeared, evaporated into the humidity that hangs beneath an East Coast storm.


  In my hand, I’m holding the resume. I unfold it. James Douglas Moore.


  And then, in a digital signature across the bottom of the page, “Cowboy.”

  He was driving back from the rock and his kid was mourning the departure. He promised he’d get them a place one day. He’d only tasted the words when they spotted the for sale sign on the side of the road.


  “It was real faded, old,” he tells me. His eyes are a damp green blue, a cough drop lodged in the throat of the sea. I feel my own family in his skin and hair and the way he uses his hands to help his lips shape stories. “Like it was probably already sold, you know.” 


  But he called, and it wasn’t sold. 


  “Guy wanted 5000 for it and I almost said yes right there. But then, okay, there’s a lot of work to be done. New roof, heating… So I got him down to 3500.”


  His palms flash as he remembers childhood: 9 of them piled into the car, driving down the Trans Canada Hwy, always passing the cabin with the carved wooden butterflies decorating its front. The for sale sign turned out to be right there- right on top of that childhood memory.


  Monte put a new roof on, fixed it up, painted the sides electric blue. He bought a wood stove from a stranger for $40. It had slumbered beneath the floorboards for 30 years because its owner “hated the smoke filling filling the house, hated having wood in the house, all of it”. It lived lifelessly in that basement but it stayed alive. 


  Monte bought butterflies from the Dollarstore and glued them to the front of his house. An homage to what came before, to both the fleetingness and eternity of stories. 99 cent butterflies become a lesson- human life is cheap and flimsy but when you watch it from a distance, the story shivering inside the setae, casting shadows across the future- it is beautiful, if weak.


  “How does the propane work for the stove?” I want to know.


  “I’m not sure how it works exactly,” Monte shrugs, “but it works.”


  The cabin rests in Cape Ray on the Trans Canada Highway, its back facing the mountains, shoulder blades against the shoreline. Salmon River is a deceptive name- the river is thick with trout and it snakes through the landscape like a fault line trying to get it right and continuously falling off the wagon. At the beach the man catches fish, easy as “fishing in a bucket”. He lays them on the shore and pauses to take a photograph, sunlight glinting off belly scales, his Swiss Army knife resting in the sand.


  He didn’t know where to spread his mother’s ashes. He knew exactly where to spread his mother’s ashes once he’d found his home. Sometimes he hikes to the abandoned radio tower, forgotten ghosts signaling stories through the wind. He plants her at the base of the tower, beneath dead strangers’ secrets, and when he pauses to eternalize his fish in a sea of lightbox, he splashes her eternity against the foam that hugs the shore. When he’s eaten six fish and the moose sausages from the hunter down the mountain he will get back into bed, full to sleeping. I imagine his rough fingers pulling the quilt up to his eyelashes.


  Monte tells me about the gold panning he’s waiting to add to his list of hobbies.


  “You can’t get up there by car, but I drove the truck up far as I could.”


  He wants to catch atomic number 79 in a sieve so that when people ask him what he’s doing between the Salmon and the tidal roar of highway he can say, “Making moose sausage, catching trout, and panning for gold.”


  The last text he sent: "Heartbreak. Gray cabin sold." I can't pan for hope beside him, our knees digging silent promise into a mountain river bank. I wait for him to send the photographs of nightfall, handmade flames balancing stars on the tips of their tongues. That'll help the hope, keep that coal ignited in the dark of my gut.

  He calls to me as I cross. “Morning”s are exchanged subconsciously here; I hear my lips creaking before I know I’m speaking. 


  I show the stranger the tiny crab body I’ve pulled from the soft waves of grass. He taps carapace. 


  “Good lobster in New Brunswick,” he tells me. “But you gotta be careful. Fish ‘em all, just pullin ‘em in and they go away.”


  “Oh yeah,” I say to the place where red trees touch sky. “Gotta practice patience.”


  “And it’s dangerous,” he nods on. “Brother of mine got caught in the ropes, pulled overboard. Found him two days later in his fishing boots. You don’t wear fishing boots to the knees for lobster. Maybe was drunk. Maybe killed himself.” He tilts coffee down his throat and tosses pupils at the black dog nosing sea spit. 


  The wind licks the silence and steers me towards the mouth of the theatre when he calls, “You don’t get seasick?”


  “Not me,” I tap my chest and what a picture, this thin fisherman leaning dark silhouette against the gathering storm, the trees tossing leaves at the hiding sun.


  “Should get on the fishing boat sometime.” He throws a thumb over his shoulder. “Just over there.” The black dog shuffles at the place the salt collects.


  “I’d love that,” I say. Steer my starboard back towards The Ship, raising a holler like a sail, “Thank you!”


  “I could talk to you all day!” he calls, but I am swallowed up by the black of the theatre, that shadowy place between Being and Performing- put your hands out to feel the corners!, the backstage of Possibility.

  She drives a black truck named Helena, purchased with 3 years' worth of insurance job money. It's Helena's first trip to the forge, back on her wheels after the accident, so I get to watch this woman relearn her love for this beast. She rubs her hands over the steering wheel + coos softly, tucking her chin against her chest. "I’m so happy to have you back, baby." Her fingers sliding over leather.


  She pops the trunk and we smoke cigarettes in the back of the car, watching the trees change colour against the mountains. Maybe this year they'll burn bright enough to coax the dark rock to turn, catch the mountain's stony eye. Maybe. A man emerges from the ground, crosses the field, watches their hopeful blaze. Pine trees pining for cracks in that rocky facade. A couple from New Brunswick, lips thick with Canadian French, are hungry to share a tale of black bear. We kill the flames of our smokes on the soles of our boots and drop the butts into the glass jar. Joceyln fills it with spent nicotine. The label on the side reveals its past life as a home for garlic chilis.


  In the truck again and we curl through the landscape. Suddenly the world will open up around us and the Bay of Fundy will be there, yawning primordially from Her eternal sunken throne between the stones. Black rocks stretch like unruly hairs towards grey sky. 


  The bladesmith teaches me to watch for the colour nicknamed possibility. Malleable is the colour white hot burning in the belly of the forge. Black hot is the face of deception, a piece of steel your fingers trust to hold whose kiss will deflesh you.


  Hammer metal for 5 hours to learn the way your weight can coax a rock. Slide the steel into the square mouth and lean forward, hands on your knees, watching for the signs. I begin to learn the language of readiness, the colours the tongues speak in. Some rounds I hit a stride and the steel curls down the blade like water. Other rounds my hold is wrong or my eyes want a turn tonguing the blade and the metal has cooled to soft red again before I’ve managed to persuade it to stretch for me. It becomes a cycle, a blink and an eternity- sliding the blade into the oven, unsheathing its neck from the mouth of flames, bargaining with weight + force + hammer + time.


  I watch as she traces the shape of tongs against the anvil, dragging chalk across the iron belly to create blueprints for metal bodies. I really like this- the smell, the sound, the smart grime, the loud early 2000s rock music, the bucket of liquified carbon, the heat, the blisters on my blackening hands.


  I really like

  this.
